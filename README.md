Linked List Algorithms

Implementation of an linked list algorithm that read user commands from stdin and run the specific function on a linked list according to the user instruction command as:
PUT n, GET n, LIST, FIRST, LAST, SORT, CLEAR, REMOVE n, EXIT where:

PUT n - Insert a integer number n into the linked list.

GET n - Get/Read nth data item from the linked list.

LIST  - List all data items from linked list.

FIRST - Show/Print the first data item from linked list.

LAST - Show/Print the last data item from linked list.

SORT - Reorder the data items from smaller to greater value on linked list.

CLEAR - Clear all allocation memory and start a empty linked list.

REMOVE n - Remove nth data item from linked list.

EXIT - Exit from program execution after make a cleanup of all allocation memory.


Source code are also stored on ReplIt for development, run and tests, it was develped at https://replit.com/@LeandroHuff/LinkedList
